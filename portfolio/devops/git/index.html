				<ul>
					<li>Complete design and implementation of git infrastructure to manage source code and configurations for 40+ software tools
					<li>Development of software versioning best practices, and education of group members on how to use the tools for more efficient development workflow
					<li>Single-handedly took control of all existing source code, and system configurations, and implemented git repositories for them. This included legacy code that needed to be transitioned from CVS systems
					<li>Self-starter on the project. Required no guidance from management, relieving the burden on them.
					<li>Proved to management the benefit of having version control systems, by showcasing the flexability of the system when quick fixes needed to be created, or when massive new developments needed to be switched out to address a bug in the current release.
