    <h1>Splunk Setup</h1>
            <p>
            To enable correct URL creation and linking with the
            Solera appliance, the Splunk app includes a setup
            and configuration screen.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of key importance are the Solera DS Appliance settings.
            By making sure these are correct, the Splunk app will
            correctly create URLs and link you off to your appliance
            when requested.
            </p>

            <p>
            Optionally, you can also specify fields that you want
            to have linked with DeepSee as well. By default the
            fields that have these integration points are
            <ul>
                <li>transport
                <li>src_ip
                <li>src_port
                <li>dest_ip
                <li>dest_port
            </ul>
            </p>
