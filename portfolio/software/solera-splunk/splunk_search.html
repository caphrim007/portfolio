    <h1>Splunk Search</h1>
            <p>
            This page shows the main integration points in the Splunk app.
            </p>

            <p>
            There is an investigate icon that can be clicked to bring up
            a modal dialog box allowing the user to link off to Soleras
            DeepSee appliance in a couple of ways (shown on the next couple
            of pages)
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition to the icon integration points, the drop arrow up
            and to the left of the investigate icon allows the user to
            jump directly into the DeepSee path to directly download the
            PCAP data or narrow their search for packets further.
            </p>

            <p>
            The final integration point can be found below the event
            data itself in the form of custom fields.
            </p>

            <p>
            The <code>Solera DeepSee App for Splunk</code> includes custom
            field extractions for
            <ul>
                <li>src_ip
                <li>dest_ip
                <li>src_port
                <li>dest_port
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            These custom fields allow the users of Splunk to link directly off
            to the Solera DeepSee app, passing those as parameters to DeepSee
            so that they will immediately be shown PCAPs relevant only to those
            fields.
