			This image is a Splunk dashboard that shows the various
			metrics that are generated by Splunk based off of the
			data that is logged by <code>resolver</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
			As you can see, the memory usage of <code>resolver</code> tends
			to hover right around the 60 megabytes mark. This is in
			stark contrast to similar applications which can easily
			consume all of the available memory.
			</p>

			<p>
			<code>resolver</code> logs metrics for the following memory
			related items
			<ul>
				<li>Resident state size (RSS)
				<li>Heap Total (the amount of memory allocated to the heap)
				<li>Heap Used (the amount of the heap actually in use)
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			This image also displays two column charts that depict the
			volume of IP addresses that resolver is capable of handling.
			</p>

			<p>
			The top right image shows successful resolutions. The bottom
			left image show unsuccessful resolutions. An unsuccessful
			resolution is simply an IP address which had no corresponding
			domain name.
			</p>

			<p>
			The final chart is a way to use splunk along with <code>resolver</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
			The top level domains are extracted using splunk, and graphed
			on a chart. They are not a separate log in <code>resolver</code>.
