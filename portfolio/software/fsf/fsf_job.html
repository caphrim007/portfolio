    <h1>Job example</h1>
    <p>Here is an example of how one would specify a job.</p>
    <p>Steps are interpreted in the order that they are listed
        and steps are reusable across Scenarios</p>
    <p>Note that the text is very readable, and you can
        instantly know what the particular job will do. This is in stark contrast
        to other systems that require you to write real executable code to
        "describe" your job.</p>
