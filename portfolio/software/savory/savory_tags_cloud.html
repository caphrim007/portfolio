	<h1>Tags in the Cloud</h1>
			<p>
			<code>savory</code> includes a tag cloud if you fancy
			it more than a tag table.
			</p>

			<p>
			The size of the words in the tag cloud is directly
			proportional to the number of URLs that have been
			tagged with that particular tag.
			</p>

			<p>
			In this screen, as with the table view, you can also
			filter on the tag name to make finding a particular
			tag easier.
			</p>
