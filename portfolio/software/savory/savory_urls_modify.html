			<p>
			All of the intelligence that <code>savory</code> gathers
			about a URL is reachable via the URL's particular page.
			</p>

			<p>
			By default you will land on the 'Url information' page
			where you are shown
			<ul>
				<li>The malicious URL
				<li>The title of the malicious URL's webpage, or a duplicate
				    string of the malicious URL if there was no page title
				<li>A list of notes about the URL
				<li>A list of tags associated with the URL
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			Tags can be added to the URL here ad-hoc. As you type into the
			tag text field, suggestions will be delivered back to you. When
			you save the URL, those new tags will be applied.
			</p>

			<p>
			Notes can be used by you or others to store arbitrary textual data
			about the URL. Usually this is human readable text that a co-worker
			may find interesting to know.
			</p>

			<p>
			Clicking any of the tabs on the page will instantly take you to the
			next page of information; there is no re-loading of the page.
