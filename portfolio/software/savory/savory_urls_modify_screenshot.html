            An interesting feature included in <code>savory</code> is the
            ability to reliably take screenshots of the malicious URLs.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is great for two big reasons
            <ul>
                <li>It allows you to see the malicious page exactly as
                    it was what <code>savory</code> recorded it. If the
                    page is later taken offline, you'll still have this
                    artifact.
                <li>These screenshots act as great training material to
                    help inform your business population of how similar
                    a malicious URL can be to a legitimate URL.
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            Screenshots are taken using Firefox and custom scripts on the
            backend. A side-effect of using this technology is that
            <code>savory</code> is also able to take screenshots of source
            code in addition to downloading it.
