			<p>
			Searching on the URLs page works much the same way that
			it does on the tags page.
			</p>

			<p>
			One difference though that you'll notice is that your
			search terms are highlighted in the returned results.
			</p>

			<p>
			When you search for a term in <code>savory</code> it looks
			across all parts of the URL. Your searches are case
			insensitive as well meaning that 'CAT' and 'cAt' will return
			the same results.
