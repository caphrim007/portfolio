    <h1>Create Roles</h1>
            <p>
            Roles encapsulate lists of permissions in <code>savory</code>
            </p>

            <p>
            Accounts can have as many roles as they need. All permissions
            in the various roles assigned to an account are enumerated
            at run-time and act as the "allow" ACL to the system.
            </p>

            <p>
            Permissions can be granted in real-time, and the affected
            user does not need to log out for the new permissions to be
            effective.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is easy to grant permissions to a role too. Just click the
            green arrow.
