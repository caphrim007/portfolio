    <h1>Modify Tags</h1>
            <p>
            When modifying a tag, you can change its name as well as
            give it a description so that you will know what it is used
            for in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
            Tags also support an expiration feature like URLs. A tag can
            expire at a pre-determined date and time. When a tag expires,
            it is simply removed from the database and all URLs that used
            to be tagged with it, will simply be un-tagged.
