			<p>
			Tags are used in <code>savory</code> to add a layer of knowledge
			to the URL.
			</p>

			<p>
			They are primarily used when re-selecting a list of URLs out of
			<code>savory</code> for use in your in-house applications.
			</p>

			<p>
			The system supports and arbitrary number of tags, and each URL
			can have an arbitrary number of tags associated with it.
			</p>

			<p>
			Tags can be created on the fly when inserting new URLs, and indeed,
			some tags are automatically created for you. You'll notice that
			a tag only has a specific number of characters it supports; A-Z,
			0-9, and some punctuation characters. These are filtered on-the-fly
			also, so you do not have to worry about filtering them.
			</p>

			<p>
			This particular display shows you the number of URLs that are
			tagged with a particular tag. Also note at the top right that
			you can filter this list in case you want to drill-down to see
			specific tag names
