    <h1>Administer Accounts</h1>
            <p>
            <code>savory</code> supports an arbitrary number of accounts and
            you are encouraged to use this feature. For instance, it is
            recommended that you use a different account for each feed injector
            that you have pointed at <code>savory</code>
            </p>

            <p>
            The settings for each account can be changed by clicking on the
            account name, and new accounts can be created using the link at
            the top right.
