            <p>
            It is recommended that you periodically remove URLs from <code>savory</code>
            that you are not actively using. This helps to keep the database lean.
            </p>

            <p>
            The system can automatically expires URLs from the database using fine-grained
            timestamps. In addition to removing the URL, <code>savory</code> gives you
            a 'last chance' option to export the contents of the URL to a file of your
            choosing.
            </p>

            <p>
            The expiration functionality is very flexible and allows for calling a custom
            script, sending email, compressing the exported data, etc. The data itself
            is exported as JSON, allowing for easy reassembly later using any of a variety
            of scripting languages.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you are running an Infoblox DNS appliance, this screen also allows you to
            blackhole the domain of the URL in realtime. This is a crucial piece of functionality
            for times when spear-phishing campaigns are launched against your organization.
