			This is the main URLs view of <code>savory</code>. Looks kinda
			familiar eh?
			</p>

			<p>
			The URLs page functions much like the 'fresh' page, but includes
			extra data about the URLs being display. In particular,
			<ul>
				<li>The tags associated with the listed URLs and the number
				    of URLs with that tag
				<li>The accounts associated with the listed URLs
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			Notice also that a date block is associated with the URLs. You
			can see it directly above the first URL. In cases when a small
			number of URLs are shown, they may have been created on different
			days. These date blocks will change to list the URLs created during
			that day.
			</p>

			<p>
			This page also gives you the ability to search for a URL using
			the provided text box.
			</p>

			<p>
			Finally, since <code>savory</code> can stores many URLs, there
			are paging links at the bottom right of the screen.
