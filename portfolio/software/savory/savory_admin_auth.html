    <h1>Administer Authentication</h1>
            <p>
            <code>savory</code> supports an advanced authentication system
            which allows for multiple forms of authentication and multiple
            layers of authentication.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you configure multiple authentication schemes, <code>savory</code>
            will apply "fall through" authentication. This means that the first
            mechanism will be tried. If it fails, the next will be tried, and
            on down through the list until authentication either suceeds or the
            end of the list is reached.
            </p>

            <p>
            The authentication system is particularly powerful in that if you
            already use a web technology with a database and user accounts,
            <code>savory</code> can make use of it to authenticate users against
            that tools database.
            </p>

            <p>
            For example, if you have a Drupal CMS running, you can have
            <code>savory</code> authenticate users against that database
            </p>
