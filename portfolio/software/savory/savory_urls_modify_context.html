            The context of a URL includes the 100+ items of intelligence
            that <code>savory</code> gradually collects over time.
            </p>

            <p>
            This information is particularly interesting if you have in-house
            tools that can detect problems using the given information.
            </p>

            <p>
            For instance, you may have an IDS system that can watch for
            MD5 values. If you integrate your IDS and <code>savory</code>
            you will be able to alert on new malicious content that may
            be downloaded in real time.
