    <h1>Notifications</h1>
    <p>Nessquik can notify you in a number of different ways once your scan
        finishes.</p>
    <p>It can also notify other people (such as fellow group members) when
        scans have finished.</p>
    <p>The reporting capabilities allow you to send Nessus reports in all
        formats. Even formats that are not supported by the underlying Nessus
        software.</p>
