    <h1>Target Selection</h1>
    <p>The target selector supports many target formats that are beyond
        what the normal Nessus client is capable of handling. For example,</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Single IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6</li>
        <li>Subnets (v4 and v6)</li>
        <li>CIDR blocks (v4 and v6)</li>
        <li>IP address ranges (v4 and v6)</li>
        <li>Hostnames</li>
        <li>Full lists of all of the above combinations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It also has the ability to exclude IP addresses (and all of the above)
        from collections of the above. So, for instance, you can create a
        set of targets that says "This whole subnet, except these particular
        hosts.</p>
